mou-mods
=============

This is the repository for some modifications I made to Mou.


CSS and Theme
---
I made two themes for Mou. The one I am using now is called Steel.

Math Support
---
I add math support to HTML export using [MathJax](http://www.mathjax.org/). Unfortunately, I am not able to put that in the preview window, since I do not have the code.
